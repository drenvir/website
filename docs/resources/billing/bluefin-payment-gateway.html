<h2>Bluefin Payment Gateway</h2>
<p>ChARM EHR is now integrated with Bluefin Payment gateway so that practices can charge their patients from within the application, making the process efficient and reduce patient waiting time. This document describes the Patient Billing Process in ChARM EHR using credit or debit card. Biller or the front office staff designated to collect payments, are the expected users of this functionality.</p>
<p>Payment is initiated either by swiping the Card in a Card reader attached to the computer on which ChARM EHR is running or keying in the card number directly in the Card field in the form. ChARM recommends usage of card reader as it is secure and error free. ChARM EHR does not store the card details, but just a reference ID provided by the Bluefin gateway.</p>
<p>Please contact <a class="link" href="mailto:support@charmehr.com">support@charmehr.com</a> to get your Gateway Account.</p>
