          <p>The following Surescripts Terms apply to users of MedicalMine’s ChARM EHR Services, through which MedicalMine facilitates electronic prescription routing and related transactions (i.e. prescription benefit and prescription history) through a network provided by Surescripts, LLC (“Surescripts”).  As a condition of your accessing the Surescripts network, you must agree to be bound by the following additional terms (“Surescripts Terms”).  These Surescripts Terms are in addition to, and do not in any way limit or replace, your obligations under MedicalMine’s Terms and Conditions.  When there is a conflict between MedicalMine’s Terms and Conditions and the Surescripts Terms, the Surescripts Terms shall govern and control.  When accessing the Surescripts network, you will be bound and remain bound by these Surescripts Terms.</p>
            <h3><b>1. Access and Use</b></h3>
            
          <p>Surescripts facilitates the transmission of electronic pharmaceutical prescribing information between participants in the Surescripts network, through which prescription benefit and history information, including eligibility, insurance coverage, and formulary information, is transmitted electronically between participants in the Surescripts network from a Data Source (as defined below) to a prescriber at the point-of-prescribing, and through which prescription messages are routed electronically from a prescriber to the pharmacy of a patient’s choice. You hereby agree and acknowledge that in accessing MedicalMine’s electronic prescription services, you will be using the services of Surescripts to facilitate such transmissions. You hereby represent and warrant that you are a licensed physician or other health care provider who is duly licensed or registered with the appropriate governmental authority to issue prescription orders and that you will only be accessing and transmitting transactions across the Surescripts network in this capacity.  You will not allow the general public access to the Surescripts network or authorize the use of the Surescripts network by any third party.  You may only initiate prescription benefit and prescription history transactions across the Surescripts network related to scheduled or walk-in outpatient visits or another specific treatment event.  You shall not access the Surescripts network or attempt to transmit prescription benefit and prescription history transactions across the Surescripts network related to an inpatient, acute or other institutional service.  Furthermore, you agree to access and utilize the Surescripts network only in accordance with these Surescripts Terms. “<u>Data Source</u>” shall mean (a) a pharmacy benefit manager (“<u>PBM</u>”), health benefit payor or administrator, or other similar entity that has entered into a written agreement with Surescripts to allow access through the Surescripts network to information in its possession; and (b) a pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or an entity that has contracted with Surescripts to become  a pharmacy aggregator and is designated as such by Surescripts, or other similar entity that has entered into a written agreement with Surescripts to allow access through the Surescripts network to information in its possession.</p>
            <p>You shall communicate with the Surescripts network only with software that has been certified by Surescripts.  The ChARM EHR Services has been certified by Surescripts for communication with the Surescripts network.  You shall not modify, change, reconfigure or otherwise alter the ChARM EHR Services in any manner.  Changes may be made to the ChARM EHR Services as required by Surescripts and/or applicable law.  Surescripts retains the right to decertify the ChARM EHR Services at any time, in which case you would be unable to transmit messages across the Surescripts network using ChARM EHR Services.</p>
            <h3><b>2. Confidentiality</b></h3>
            
          <p>You agree to keep confidential any and all of Surescripts’ information, as well as the  information and data of all entities that have contracted with Surescripts to become either a pharmacy or prescriber aggregator and is designated as such by Surescripts (“certified aggregators”), entities that have been designated by Surescripts as a value-added reseller of the Surescripts services, and connectivity to other entities that aggregate prescribers or pharmacies (“certified VARs”), Data Sources, prescribers, health care providers, or facilities, technology vendors, and other entities or individuals that have entered into a written agreement with Surescripts, either directly or indirectly, in order to access, provide, or communicate through the Surescripts network, whether explicitly marked confidential or reasonably believed to be confidential.  All Surescripts documentation and materials available to you through MedicalMine are deemed confidential.  </p>
            <h3><b>3. Compliance with Applicable Law</b></h3>
            
          <p>You will use the ChARMTracker Services in a manner that complies with all applicable law.  You hereby certify that you have obtained or will obtain any and all necessary patient consents and authorizations required by applicable law, including all federal, state, local, common law, rules, regulations, directives, and guidelines prior to sending transactions across the Surescripts network, including electronic prescriptions. </p>
          <p>Without limiting the foregoing, you shall obtain the consent of the patient prior to requesting prescription history for such patient via the Surescripts network.  You agree to comply with any privacy and patient consent policies of Surescripts related to the delivery of “Private Information” as may be published by Surescripts from time to time.  You acknowledge that Data Sources may impose additional privacy and patient consent policies on the delivery of “Private Information” through the Surescripts network.  “Private Information” means: (i) Protected Health Information (“PHI”), as defined under HIPAA and related regulations, created or received on behalf of, or received from Surescripts; (ii) Nonpublic Personal Financial Information and, as applicable, Nonpublic Personal Health Information, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; or (iii) any data or information that: (1) relates to an individual, and (2) identifies or can reasonably be believed to form the basis for identifying an individual (such as, but not limited to, an individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security number, driver’s license number, financial account number, or any other unique identifier).</p>
          <p>You hereby represent and warrant that all messages transmitted via the Surescripts network will originate from the United States. You hereby agree and acknowledge that each of MedicalMine and Surescripts reserves the right to terminate your use of the Surescripts network at any time, for any or no reason, with or without notice.</p>

            <h3><b>6. Indemnification</b></h3>
            <p>You shall indemnify and hold harmless Surescripts and MedicalMine (and their respective affiliates, officers, directors employees or agents) from and against any and all loss, damage, or expense (or claims of damage or liability) asserted against Surescripts or MedicalMine (or their respective affiliates, officers, directors employees or agents) by third parties and arising directly out of any breach of these Surescripts Terms, any loss of connectivity to the Surescripts network due to acts or omissions inconsistent with the Surescripts Terms, or information provided to the Surescripts by you or by MedicalMine from you, or arising out of the use of such information when furnished by Surescripts to MedicalMine, you or to other third persons.</p>
            <h3><b>7. Force Majeure</b></h3>
